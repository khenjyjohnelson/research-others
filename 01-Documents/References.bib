SMME has important role in reducing unemployment and poverty rate, providing vacancies, increasing prosperity, and constructing character of the nation. The small enterprise has some advantages compares to the medium one which are the capability of accommodating employee, local resources oriented, and flexible. Considering those points, SMME should be developed by including training in SMME field into account. There have been some coaching, training, and counseling related to SMME from various sources as in goverment and lecturers from particular educational institution. Furthermore, regarding the development of SMME, there are some problems that can be identified such as difficulties in looking for resource person who is suitable at his/her speciality in order to solve the problems in it, overlapping training, unsustainable training, no more further coordination between SMME and resource person after the training or workshop is done. All these problems generally happened because there is no accurate data and information regarding the kind of training that have been attended, SMME network,and What sort of problem that particular SMME face.

   abstract = {In the humanist philosophy of Richard Rorty, the existence and concept of nihilism is used to scrutinize the theory of irony. Nihilism and the humanitarian crisis of cruelty underpin Rorty’s philosophical thinking. One of his basic ideas is how humans have a particular attitude in perceiving reality, which can be found in terms of irony. This term provides a humanist grounding for coping with humanitarian issues in the present day, in this regard functioning as a frame for understanding put forward by Rorty within human selfhood. This literature review is based on both primary and secondary sources, with the formers referring to books written by Rorty, while the latter comprises information from books, journals, articles, and research papers discussing Rorty and human philosophy, especially existentialism. The research steps undertaken were data collection, classification, description, and analysis, and methodological elements were interpretation, heuristics, compilation, and reflection. The results provide an understanding of the use of Rorty’s word, “irony,” a consequence of humans tending to overlook their position as human beings. Humans are apparently ironic for seeing things critically, yet are capable of taking steps in any conditions. The meaning of irony can be understood as humans in the present day acting for others (in a social context). The virtue of ironists is conscious thought that may exist regarding the presence of others inside themselves, with language simply being an intermediary, functioning as a tool for dialectical needs. Humans construct history by considering three things that can be classified as morality, language, and socially constructed basic investigations.},

Therefore, it needs a good incentive to develop a faster and more effective method to predicting the interaction between compound and protein. Predicting the unobserved link of CPI can be done with Ant Colony Optimization for Link Prediction (ACO_LP) algorithms. Each ant selects its path according to the pheromone value and the heuristic information in the link. The path passed by the ant is evaluated and the pheromone information on each link is updated according to the quality of the path. The pheromones on each link are used as the final value of similarity between nodes. The ACO_LP are tested on benchmark CPI data: Nuclear Receptor, G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR), Ion Channel, and Enzyme. Result show that the accuracy values for Nuclear Receptor, GPCR, Ion Channel, and Enzyme dataset are 0.62, 0.62, 0.74, and 0.79 respectively.

The production process at this company still uses the traditional MMH (Manual Material Handling) method which causes various complaints from employees, so it is necessary to think of an alternative method or tool that can change this manual process. Based on this, this research was conducted to design a tool that can optimize the material handling process and reduce musculoskeletal risks that arise in employees. There are 3 methods used, namely anthropometry, the Nordic Body Map (NBM) questionnaire, and work posture analysis using the REBA method. After testing, it was found that the trolley table that was in accordance with the employee's anthropometry was able to reduce employee complaints by 25% on several parts of the worker's body. From the results of the REBA assessment, a score of 6 (moderate) is obtained if using a table trolley, while without a trolley it produces a score of 12 (has a very high risk). The results of this research are considered to have a significant impact both in optimizing the production system, as well as in terms of employee safety and health from an employee health and safety perspective.},

One of the options to do this is by using bicycle sprocket to transmit power until it reaches the expected speed. Particular size of sprocket is needed to gain the intended speed. To determine the axact size several test were needed, by combining various the speed rotation and sprocket size. This research aimed to determine the exact size of sprocket in order to reach 626 rpm. Variables used were spocket size and axis spin speed (rpm). Data collecting methods used were literature study and observation. Data analysis was done using parametric analysis technique. The result showed that to reach sprocket speed of 626 rpm, required 54 rpm at N₂ (18 T), 63 rpm at N₂ (21 T), and 72 rpm at N₂ (24 T) to reach 626 rpm. And the size of spockets are N₁ (34 T), N₂ (18 T, 21 T, 24 T), N₃ (42 T), N₄ (11T), N₅ (24 T) and N₆ (15 T).},

Abstract This study aims to determine whether there are differences in rates of return and risk between shariah and conventional stock indices. This study uses stock indexes JII and LQ45 in the 2014 research period up to 2018. The data used in this study is secondary data sourced from the closing price of shares on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The static method used for hypothesis testing is Mann Whitney's test. The result of this study indicates that there is no difference between the rate of return and risk between the JII and LQ45 stock indexes. This shows that the screening criteria applied to Islamic stocks does not affect stock performance compared to conventional shares. Most of the shares included in the JII stock index are also included in the LQ45 index which means that the majority of Islamic stock indexes are large market capitalization and high liquidity.},

The skin color of some fruits may be used as one of the numerous indicators to determine whether they have achieved their peak degree of ripeness. Similar to other fruits, the skin color of an Ambarella fruit indicates its maturity. However, determining the ripeness of the Ambarella fruit was assessed manually, which is time-consuming, inefficient, taxing, requires a large number of employees, and has the potential to result in discrepancies. This study aims to classify the ripeness of the Ambarella fruit using the deep learning approach, specifically using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The new family of EfficientNetV2 is trained to classify the Ambarella fruit ripeness. The pre-trained models are utilized in this work, and the training was done via transfer learning through fine-tuning. EfficientNetV2B0 achieves the highest accuracy of 100% despite having a smaller size than the other EfficientNetV2 models used in this work.},

The process has several shortcomings, such as requiring a long time to make attendance; the attendance paper is lost, the administration must enter attendance data one by one into the computer. To overcome this, the paper proposed a web-based student attendance system that uses face recognition. In the proposed system, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to detect faces in images, deep metric learning is used to produce facial embedding, and K-NN is used to classify student's faces. Thus, the computer can recognize faces. From the experiments conducted, the system was able to recognize the faces of students who did attend and their attendance data was automatically saved. Thus, the university administration is alleviated in recording attendance data.},

Student attendance data can be used as an indicator of student discipline and as a determinant of student eligibility to take the exam. The recording of student attendance at Universal University is still done manually by signing the attendance register document. The problem that arises from using the manual method is that a student can sign the attendance of other students, requires supervision, and burdens the administration in managing attendance data. Therefore, this study proposes the design and implementation of a student attendance application using the X100-C fingerprint machine. The application made is presented in the form of a web-based application. Through the attendance application, admin work is helped and minimizes fraud that arises from recording attendance manually using paper.},

Like several other types of fruit, the skin color can be used to determine the ripeness of Ambarella fruit. However, determining the ripeness of Ambarella fruit is still done manually by human labor, which is considered time-consuming, tiring, requires a lot of workers, and can cause inconsistencies. The development of technology such as computer vision allows the determination of fruit ripeness to be carried out automatically, accurate- ly, and relatively quickly. This study aims to classify the ripeness of the Ambarella fruit based on its color feature with the use of machine learning. The color features used are RGB, HSV, and L∗a∗b∗, with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) as the classifiers. Segmentation was done using the Otsu method. Google Colab, OpenCV, and scikit-learn are utilized in carrying out the experiments. The performance result shows that the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure were achieved by using SVM on the L∗a∗b∗ color feature.},

Unfortunately, there are times when visitors do not obey the rules by not wearing a mask; therefore, surveillance must be conducted. However, manual surveillance to check if a person wearing a mask can be a tedious task. This research aims to propose an automatic face mask detection that can detect if a person is using a mask or not. The proposed method combines face detection and classification using deep learning. The face detection is done using USM sharpening, CenterFace, and two pre-trained models, the MobileNet V2 and DenseNet 121 are used to classify if a person wears a face mask or not. The pre-trained models were fine-tuned using two datasets. Google Colab and libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and Scikit-learn were utilized.

   abstract = {Today's research on the topic of Machine learning has increased sharply. Machine learning is the future of the world, in the future it will be a revolution in every computer-bound science. This paper examines the field of Reinforcement learning from a computer science perspective. Reinforcement learning is part of Machine learning. In general machine learning is divided into three categories, namely supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning requires labeled data to analyze data, training and make conclusions, which can be used for mapping new values. Otherwise, Unsupervised learning does not use labeled data, which is more suitable for relatively irregular problems. In contrast to Reinforcement learning that is based on trial and error, by experimenting on the environment then get a response that will improve its ability. This work is summarized based on the history of Reinforcement learning and the selection of current research. This paper discusses central issues in reinforcement learning, from history, Reinforcement learning models, multiinform Reinforcement learning, including comparison of exploration and exploitation. Ends with a Reinforcement learning implementation survey of several systems. Reinforcement learning is the most suitable Machine learning in learning new things from scratch without human intervention in learning, most of Reinforcement learning is used for in-game learning. But the learning may takes a long time and is uncertain. Keywords-reinforcement learning, history, trial and error, RL model, multiagent RL, exploration and exploitation, literature review Abstrak-Dewasa ini penelitian mengenai topik Machine learning telah meningkat tajam. Machine learning adalah masa depan dunia, kedepannya ini akan menjadi revolusi dalam segalah ilmu yang terikat dengan komputerisasi. Paper ini meneliti bidang Reinforcement learning dari perspektif ilmu komputer. Reinforcement learning merupakan bagian dari Machine learning. Secara umum machine learning dibagi menjadi tiga kategori, yaitu supervised learning, unsupervised learning, dan reinforcement learning. Supervised learning memerlukan data berlabel untuk menganalisis data, pelatihan dan membuat kesimpulan, yang dapat digunakan untuk pemetaan nilai-nilai baru. Sebaliknya, Unsupervised learning tidak memenggunakan data berlabel, yang mana lebih cocok untuk masalah yang relatif tidak beraturan. Berbeda dengan Reinforcement learning yang berbasis trial and error, dengan mencoba-coba pada lingkungannya kemudian mendapatkan respon yang akan meningkatkan kemampuannya. Karya ini dirangkum berdasarkan sejarah bidang Reinforcement learning dan pemilihan riset saat ini. Paper ini membahas isu-isu sentral dalam reinforcement learning, mulai dari sejarah, model Reinforcement learning, multiagent Reinforcement learning termasuk melakukan perbandingan dari eksplorasi dan eksploitasi. Diakhiri dengan survei penerapan Reinforcement Learning terhadap beberapa sistem. Reinforcement learning merupakan Machine learning yang paling cocok dalam mempelajari hal baru dari nol tanpa campur tangan manusia dalam pembelajarannya, kebanyakan dari Reinforcement learning digunakan untuk belajar dalam game.

In a recent survey, 70% of tablet owners and 53% of smartphone owners stated that they use public wifi hotspots. The biggest threat to public wifi security is how a hacker positions himself as a liaison between victims and Authorized Access Points. To do this the hacker creates an Unauthorized Access Point (Fake Access Point). We took a pen tester/attacker POV in this artikel for educational purposes, so that users may know the stages of Fake Access Point attack based on Kali Linux, Fluxion. For the digital evidence analysis stage, we used the customized OSCAR (Obtain information, Strategies, Collect Evidence, Analyze and Report) methods, where attacking is the stage for preparation, determining which wifi Access Points is going to be the target of the attack, and carrying out attacks. While, analysis is the stage of analyzing the steps of attack and how to distinguish between AAP and UAP. The results of our research are that after determining the target, the pen tester/attacker will use aircrack-ng on Fluxion to get a handshake, create a fake web interface, then launch a deauth all attack, also known as DoS, to AAP so that the victim / client cannot connect with the AAP and switch to Fake Access Point. The fake web interface will then ask the victim to enter the password, where after the password is found, the pen tester/attacker can see it through Fluxion. As a precautionary measure, the difference between a Fake Access Point and an Authorized Access Point is found in the presence or absence of the padlock symbol (Android) or an exclamation point (Windows 10).},

This was a normative legal research, with statute approach. The results and discussion of this research showed that the factors causing the different arrangements of imported new goods are related to the background of the establishment of the legislations, namely the Trade Law, Regulation of the Minister of Trade No. 48/M-DAG/PER/7/2015, Regulation of the Minister of Trade No. 51/M-DAG/PER/7/2015, and Regulation of the Minister of Finance No. 6/PMK.010/PER/2017 and the fact that the theory of legal system is not implemented because such legal system contains the stages of the formulation of laws and regulations which include harmonization and synchronization among Pancasila, the 1945 Constitution, and legislation. Law is declared to be valid if it is sourced and based on norms established by higher norms, in this case the principle of lex superiori derogate legi inferiori. An effort to harmonize and synchronize the differences in the arrangement of imported new goods is to pay attention to the procedures for the establishment of legislation especially regarding the harmonization and synchronization stage that must be undertaken by the Directorate General of Legislation (DJPP)},

To detect a moving object in real-time like vessel, there are complex processes than to detect the object that does not moving. There are some issues that faced in detection process of moving object in UAV, called constraint uncertainty factor (UCF) such as environment, type of object, illumination, camera of UAV, and motion. One of the practical problems that become concern of researchers in the past few years is motion analysis. Motion of an object in each frame carries a lot of information about the pixels of moving objects which has an important role as the image descriptor. In this paper, we use SUED (Segmentation using edge-based dilation) algorithm to detect vessel. The concept of the SUED algorithm is combining the frame difference and segmentation process to obtain optimal results. This research showed that the SUED method having problem to detect the vessel even though we combine it with sobel operator. using the combination of wavelet and Sobel operator on the detection of edges obtained increasing in the number of DR about 3%, but then FAR also increased from 41.23% to 52.09%.},

Adversarial examples are among the most serious types of attacks in which the attacker designs inputs that can cause the machine learning system to generate incorrect outputs. Considering the architecture using multiple sensor devices, hacking even a few sensors can create a significant risk; an attacker can attack the machine learning model through the hacked sensors. Some studies demonstrated the possibility of adversarial examples on the deep neural network (DNN) model based on IoT sensors, but it was assumed that an attacker must access all features. The impact of hacking only a few sensors has not been discussed thus far. Therefore, in this study, we discuss the possibility of attacks on DNN models by hacking only a small number of sensors. In this scenario, the attacker first hacks few sensors in the system, obtains the values of the hacked sensors, and changes them to manipulate the system, but the attacker cannot obtain and change the values of the other sensors. We perform experiments using the human activity recognition model with three sensor devices attached to the chest, wrist, and ankle of a user, and demonstrate that attacks are possible by hacking a small number of sensors.},

The results of this study indicate that in the post-Covid-19 pandemic era, hoax information is frequently associated with ‘vaccines’ and ‘covid’, with 113 and 111 occurrences respectively. This is due to public skepticism regarding the safety and effectiveness of the Covid-19 vaccine, leading to the dissemination of hoaxes aimed at discouraging vaccination.

This system aims to enable universities to provide quality higher education services in accordance with standards so that they can produce graduates who are also of high quality. One of the standards implemented is for the learning preparation process. For this reason, information technology support is needed that can help carry out learning preparation so that it can function properly. A common problem is that the existing systems are not yet integrated because they are built based on momentary needs and not designed as a whole as a unified whole. This study aims to provide a study and a brief description of the application of enterprise architecture in mapping information technology to serve the implementation of learning preparation standards in universities. The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) provides a framework that can show the architecture of integrated information systems and technology based on the organization's business needs so as to achieve alignment between existing business and technology. The Architecture Development Methods (ADM) as part of TOGAF is the method used in developing the SPMI architecture framework for higher education because the stages in it are considered complete enough to design a harmonious vision, business, information system, and technology architecture. The result of the research is a comprehensive and efficient architectural conceptual framework from the learning preparation process to information systems and supporting technology which is expected to be a reference for universities to carry out good practices in implementing their internal quality assurance systems.},

Batamcity shows that there is poor scheduling of transportation of garbage from community settlements to temporary collection points (TPS) to the final disposal site (TPA) of Batam City. The study aims to optimize the number of waste transporters by applying a genetic algorithm. In this study, genetic algorithm can optimize the number of Batam City TPS transporters based on the number of TPS per district, the volume of TPS, and the distance between TPS to TPA. The number of waste transporters available in Batam City in dump trucks, arm rolls, pickups, and motorized pedicabs are 54, 44, 100, and 40 respectively. The result determines the optimization numberof waste transporters with a genetic algorithm succeeded in making the volume gap as small as possible, particularly 15.96% with the target volume of waste transportation and reducing 26.38% of the average gap in the actual volume of waste transportation. In addition, the non-transportable wastevolume optimally by using dump trucks, arm rolls, pickups, and motorized pedicabs is 58.92, 120.21, 346.31, and 380.74 ton respectively.},

   abstract = {The prediction of Compound-Protein Interactions (CPI) is an essential step in the drug-target analysis for developing new drugs as well as for drug repositioning. One challenging issue in this field is that commonly there are more numbers of non-interacting compound-protein pairs than interacting pairs. This problem causes bias, which may degrade the prediction of CPI. Besides, currently, there is not much research on CPI prediction that compares data sampling techniques to handle the class imbalance problem. To address this issue, we compare four data sampling techniques, namely Random Under-sampling (RUS), Combination of Over-Under-sampling (COUS), Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), and Tomek Link (T-Link). The benchmark CPI data: Nuclear Receptor and G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) are used to test these techniques. Area Under Curve (AUC) applied to evaluate the CPI prediction performance of each technique. Results show that the AUC values for RUS, COUS, SMOTE, and T-Link are 0.75, 0.77, 0.85 and 0.79 respectively on Nuclear Receptor data and 0.70, 0.85, 0.91 and 0.72 respectively on GPCR data. These results indicate that SMOTE has the highest AUC values. Furthermore, we found that the SMOTE technique is more capable of handling class imbalance problems on CPI prediction compared to the remaining three other techniques.},

   abstract = {User Experience (UX) provides insights into the users' product perceptions while using or intending to use an application. Software products are known for complexity and changeability, starting from requirements engineering until the product operation. Users often evaluate software UX based on a prototype; however, UX is semantically embedded in the software requirements, a crucial indicator for project success. The problem of current UX evaluation methods is their dependence on the actual involvement of users or experts, a time-consuming process. First, this paper builds a benchmark dataset of UX based on textual software requirements crowdsourcing several UX experts. Second, the paper develops a machine learning model to measure UX based on the dataset. This research describes the dataset characteristics and reports its statistical internal consistency and reliability. Results indicate a high Cronbach Alpha and a low root mean square error of the dataset. We conclude that the new benchmark dataset could be used to estimate UX instantly without the need for subjective UX evaluation. The dataset will serve as a foundation of UX features for machine learning models.},

   abstract = {<p>An inventory management problem is addressed for a make-to-order supply chain that has inventory holding and/or manufacturing locations at each node. The lead times between nodes and production capacity limits are heterogeneous across the network. This study focuses on a single product, a multi-period centralized system in which a retailer is subject to an uncertain stationary consumer demand at each time period. Two sales scenarios are considered for any unfulfilled demand: backlogging or lost sales. The daily inventory replenishment requests from immediate suppliers throughout the network are modeled and optimized using three different approaches: (1) deterministic linear programming, (2) multi-stage stochastic linear programming, and (3) reinforcement learning. The performance of the three methods is compared and contrasted in terms of profit (reward), service level, and inventory profiles throughout the supply chain. The proposed optimization strategies are tested in a stochastic simulation environment that was built upon the open-source OR-Gym Python package. The results indicate that, of the three approaches, stochastic modeling yields the largest increase in profit, whereas reinforcement learning creates more balanced inventory policies that would potentially respond well to network disruptions. Furthermore, deterministic models perform well in determining dynamic reorder policies that are comparable to reinforcement learning in terms of their profitability.</p>},

Recently, spare parts inventory management has been attracting more attention due to the “right-to-repair” movement which requires that manufacturers provide sufficient spare parts throughout the life-cyle of their products to reduce waste so as to achieve sustainability. In this review, 148 papers regarding spare parts inventory management published from 2010 to 2020 are examined. The studies are classified based on two groups of perspectives. The first group includes the characteristics of spare parts, products, inventory systems, and supply chains, while the second group focuses on the characteristics of research methodologies and topics in the reviewed studies. The novelty of this literature review is three-fold. Firstly, we focus on analyzing the supply chain structure of different inventory networks for managing spare parts. Secondly, we classify the current literature based on analytics techniques, i.e., descriptive analytics, predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics. Finally, the research gaps in this field are discussed from the perspective of reverse logistics, consumer durable goods, inventory network structure and policy, spare parts demand pattern modeling, and big data analytics.</p>},

   abstract = {The competitive advantage of the Creative Industry is an important strategy to succeed in a highly competitive global business market. The Indonesian creative industry is a strategic industry characterised by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). However, these enterprises face challenges, such as low entrepreneurial orientation, low digital literation to access the global market, limited capital, lack of digital payment methods, and a focus on conventional marketing activities rather than implementing Entrepreneurial Marketing (EM). The previous research proposed that Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO) and Entrepreneurial Marketing (EM) could increase competitive advantage due to the moderating role of local wisdom culture and the government's role. Therefore, this research aims to analyse the moderating role of local wisdom culture and the government's role in the effect of EO and EM on sustainable competitive advantage development. The quantitative research design employed a self-administered survey distributed to 400 top and middle managers within the superior and priority subsectors of the creative industry. The survey targeted four provinces in Indonesia known for their high contributions to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP >9 %), based on the ‘Purposive Sampling’ method. The results of the SEM analysis, based on 330 useable data points, show that Local Wisdom and Government's Role significantly mediate the relationship between Sustainable Competitive Advantage and Sustainable Business Performance. The research results imply that it is necessary to empower the government's role in providing information technology infrastructure to facilitate the creative industry's access to the global marketplace and encourage the use of digital payment methods for the rapid development of sustainable competitive advantage. Theoretical contributions extend to Dynamic Capability Theory by integrating Resources Advantage Theory and Resources Base View Theory, including the moderating role of Local Wisdom and Government's Role, and examining the relationship of EO and EM with sustainable competitive advantage.},

   abstract = {In how far can algorithms take care of your creative work? Generative design is currently changing our conventional understanding of design in its basic principles. For decades, design was a handmade issue and postproduction a job for highly specialized professionals. Generative Design nowadays has become a popular instrument for creating artwork, models and animations with programmed algorithms. By using simple languages such as JavaScript's p5.js and Processing based on Java, artists and makers can create everything from interactive typography and textiles to 3D-printed products to complex infographics. Computers are not only able to provide images, but also generate variations and templates in a professional quality. Pictures are being pre-optimized, processed and issued by algorithms. The profession of a designers will become more and more that of a director or conductor at the human-computer-interface. What effects does generative design have on the future creative field of designers? To find an answer to this complex field we analyze several examples of projects from a range of international designers and fine arts as well as commercial projects. In an exercise I will guide you step-by-step through a tutorial for creating your own visual experiments that explore possibilities in color, form and images.},

   abstract = {This paper focuses on the modern transformation and creative development of urban handicrafts. Since handicrafts that reflect the style of different times and serve the human society, the development of handicrafts is regarded as a "historical intermediate." The paper explores the nature of handicrafts and the possible combination with modern design from the historical comparison of rural handicrafts and urban industry. It firstly analyzes the important role of the media, techniques, and themes contained in the language of handicrafts. Then it interprets them from the three aspects of material basis, core skills, and identification models. It is clarified that the modern transformation of urban handicrafts needs to understand and follow the original language of traditional handicrafts as a prerequisite, and then realize the creative reconstruction of handicrafts language. The paper looks at the integration and development of urban handicrafts and modern design from an open perspective. Craftsmen are becoming an alliance of artists and designers in the creative community. They explore the development of urban handicrafts through composite media creation, handicraft improvement, and theme program innovation. The new aesthetic direction interprets the modern design concept of handicraft culture.},

   abstract = {The competitive advantage of the Creative Industry is an important strategy to succeed in a highly competitive global business market. The Indonesian creative industry is a strategic industry characterised by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). However, these enterprises face challenges, such as low entrepreneurial orientation, low digital literation to access the global market, limited capital, lack of digital payment methods, and a focus on conventional marketing activities rather than implementing Entrepreneurial Marketing (EM). The previous research proposed that Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO) and Entrepreneurial Marketing (EM) could increase competitive advantage due to the moderating role of local wisdom culture and the government's role. Therefore, this research aims to analyse the moderating role of local wisdom culture and the government's role in the effect of EO and EM on sustainable competitive advantage development. The quantitative research design employed a self-administered survey distributed to 400 top and middle managers within the superior and priority subsectors of the creative industry. The survey targeted four provinces in Indonesia known for their high contributions to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP >9 %), based on the ‘Purposive Sampling’ method. The results of the SEM analysis, based on 330 useable data points, show that Local Wisdom and Government's Role significantly mediate the relationship between Sustainable Competitive Advantage and Sustainable Business Performance. The research results imply that it is necessary to empower the government's role in providing information technology infrastructure to facilitate the creative industry's access to the global marketplace and encourage the use of digital payment methods for the rapid development of sustainable competitive advantage. Theoretical contributions extend to Dynamic Capability Theory by integrating Resources Advantage Theory and Resources Base View Theory, including the moderating role of Local Wisdom and Government's Role, and examining the relationship of EO and EM with sustainable competitive advantage.},

Because the MySQL database is built-in and configured in each hosting, it is developed directly with the MySQL software. Laragon software includes MySQL and Apache software for easy-to-use workflows. A database is an information model that stores and processes ordered data. In simpler words, a model that stores information of the same type and presents it through the given requests. For example, a bookshelf is a database, that is, it stores objects of the same type (books), or a book of telephone numbers, which stores information of the same type, such as name, phone number, is also a database. Database (DB) is a collection of data organized according to certain rules that provide general principles of description, storage and manipulation of data independently of application programs.},

But sometimes there are some cases found in the Puskesmas such as cases in the drug warehouse. This problem exists at the Cempaka Oku Timur Health Center. One solution to overcome this problem is to design and build an inventory data system for drug management in the warehouse. With the existence of a drug inventory data system, it is hoped that it can help drug management more easily. To achieve the goal in tackling this problem is to improve the drug supply data system with the Fefo method and use the Laravel framework using a mysql database. The results of the development show that the resulting drug inventory has features that can handle warehouse cases well and are useful for warehouse officers at the Cempaka Oku Timur Health Center.},

One application of information technology in the field of education is the existence of a subject scheduling information system. However, until now, the scheduling system at MTsN 03 Madiun still uses the manual method by the curriculum staff. Previously, a joint task distribution meeting was held with the teachers, which then the curriculum staff would confirm the schedule with the instructor, then the admin would supervise one by one the schedules of the teachers who were still empty. Then the schedule needs to be confirmed back to the students. The result of these conditions has an impact on the lack of timely publication of subject schedules which reduces the effectiveness of the learning system. It is not uncommon for errors to occur in scheduling, such as the large number of teaching hours on an inappropriate schedule or subject schedules that clash with other subjects. The schedule that has been made must guarantee that there will be no conflicting schedules, both in hours and instructors. In addition, it takes a long time to make a schedule because the scheduling department needs to adjust the availability of space and teachers. Therefore we need a subject scheduling system that can simplify and minimize errors that occur when preparing schedules. In this study, the method used when collecting data was the observation method, interview method and literature study. In addition, the software development method used was the waterfall method. This system was designed and built using MySQL and PHP as database storage. This subject scheduling system can facilitate curriculum staff and teachers in managing subject schedule information.},

   abstract = {The final thesis assignment plays a crucial role in enabling students to meet the graduation requirements from college. However, the process of scheduling guidance for the final assignment between students and lecturers still relies on several common applications such as WhatsApp or email, which are not specifically designed for this purpose. The accumulation of incoming messages and various types of message information poses a challenge in the guidance process, leading to missed messages between students and lecturers and a lack of recorded information regarding the history of the process and guidance materials. These are some of the current issues. This paper aims to evaluate the functionality, quality, and reliability of the system by conducting black box testing on the application developed for the student final project guidance information system. This application uses the Iconix process-based SDLC (system development life cycle) model, covering student and lecturer profile information, guidance information, proposal submission, progress of the final thesis assignment, meeting schedule, guidance material, discussion forum, survey evaluation, and contact information. The SDLC model is employed in this research because it can effectively and efficiently achieve project targets, enhance software quality standards, and assist in better risk management and adaptation to change. The model comprises planning, needs analysis, design using the Iconix process, implementation, system testing, and maintenance. The Iconix process is utilized for system design modeling and analysis. Black box testing is performed on the system to verify that the system’s functional requirements are operating correctly. The findings of this research can serve as a control for management in the service and administration of final assignment guidance in higher education.},

Online sales have become one of the transaction media where buyers do not have to converge with sellers to view products and make purchases. The rise of the current hijrah trend has a direct impact on increasing sales of hijab among young people.Coupled with the very diverse Indonesian hijab culture, there are many types, models and designs of beautiful hijabs which are not only used to cover the genitals but become one of today's fashion items. One of the frameworks that aids in building sales applications is Laravel. Laravel is an open source-based programming framework that is used by many developers from around the world. Laravel is also one of the frameworks that can help developers to maximize the use of PHP in the website development process. In addition, Laravel also has several excellent features, such as a template engine, routing, and modularity. Laravel framework has benefits in file structure and coding than ordinary native PHP. The laravel framework has the migrate function so that it is easier to manage the database. The laravel framework has a templating engine that can help to build a more efficient front end display with the blade functions provided by laravel. The bootstrap framework with its CSS makes the application look nicer and neater. The application that the author built is not perfect so there are still many shortcomings, both in terms of appearance and facilities that are more user friendly. In addition, this application also has shortcomings in the payment section which is still manual due to the limitations of the author's knowledge so that it has not been able to make payment functions that are integrated with virtual money such as gopay, funds, or OVO. ABSTRAK-Persaingan antar toko menjadi sengit karena telah menerapkan penjualan offline dan online. Penjualan online sudah dijadikan salah satu media transaksi dimana pembeli tidak harus bertemu dengan penjual untuk melihat produk dan melakukan pembelian. Maraknya trend hijrah saat ini berdampak langsung dengan peningkatan penjualan hijab dikalangan anak muda. Ditambah dengan budaya hijab Indonesia yang sangat beragam membuat banyak tipe, model dan desain hijab cantik yang mana tidak hanya digunakan untuk menutup aurat tetapi menjadi salah satu item fashion saat ini. Salah satu framework yang membantu dalam pembangunan aplikasi penjualan adalah laravel. Laravel merupakan sebuah kerangka kerja pemrograman yang berbasis open source yang dipakai oleh banyak developer dari seluruh dunia. Laravel juga menjadi salah satu framework yang dapat membantu developper untuk memaksimalkan penggunaan PHP didalam proses pengembangan website. Selain itu, Laravel juga memiliki beberapa fitur unggulan, seperti template engine, routing, dan modularity. Framework laravel memiliki kelebihan dalam struktur file dan koding dari pada php native biasa. Framework laravel memiliki fungsi migrate sehingga lebih mudah untuk pengelolaan databasenya. Framwork laravel memiliki templating engine yang dapat membantu membangun tampilkan front end lebih efisien dengan fungsi blade yang telah disediakan oleh laravel. Framwork bootstrap dengan css nya membuat tampilan aplikasi menjadi lebih bagus dan rapi. Aplikasi yang peneliti bangun belum sempurna sehingga masih banyak kekurangannya, baik dari segi tampilan maupun fasilitas yang lebih user friendly.

This shop also concentrates on the process of repairing motorbikes, maintaining motorbikes, and modifying motorbikes as well as selling motorbike spare parts, which was founded in 2020, and with the reason for the establishment of this shop, because of the expertise or background of the shop owner is an expert in the automotive field. In addition, the owner also sees that there is no motorcycle spare part shop in the area, so this is a good opportunity. The purpose of this research is to find out every problem, design the system, and implement the system that has been designed. By determining the system design method used to conduct this research using the waterfall method, and also concludes from the research results that the sales application at the MN Motor Store still uses a manual system and is not well structured. With the system that has been built, , it's expected that it can be more useful, effective also in managing inventory data and selling motorcycle spare parts. And the system implementation process at the MN Motor Shop is carried out by first installing the system software installation process as well as the necessary supporting hardware, the system design process is only up to the proposed system implementation stage.},

Bouquet Lampung provides a variety of bouquet products such as flower bouquets, snack bouquets, balloon bouquets, and money bouquets. Bouquet Lampung itself has the advantage of being able to order the type of bouquet according to the wishes of the buyer. In ordering and determining the desire for the type of bouquet, it is still done via whatsapp, the admin must reply to a chat from the buyer to ensure the type and product of the bouquet ordered. However, because of the large number of bouquet orders, not all buyers get good service, the large number of determinations of the wishes of the type of bouquet from the buyer makes it difficult for sellers to reply to orders one by one. With these problems, a system is needed to facilitate the ordering process on Bouquet Lampung, it takes a bouquet ordering application design. The system is supported by a database that will help the performance of the Bouquet Lampung store to be faster, more effective and efficient. Of all designs, research involves a process of user involvement so that it can be understood and used by users. The researcher uses the user centered design (UCD) method to overcome the user's inability to use the system. The user centered design (UCD) method involves potential users in the early stages of development so that potential users can provide input about the ordering system interface.},

In this study, the method used in research is Research and Development and the system development method uses Rapid Application Development. A website-based scheduling system that uses the Shortest Job First algorithm was developed to shorten long queues. Average waiting time can be reduced by finding the shortest job first, which solves the smallest average waiting time for various operations. By implementing Shortest Job First it can produce a good counseling schedule with a smaller waiting time thus reducing the level of long queues. The accuracy rate of this system is 98.18% accurate.},

In the city of Batam, this phenomenon is increasingly thick in traditional markets, due to trading activities that occur every day and a very high cash circulation. This research was conducted in the traditional market of Nagoya Baru Jodoh, a sample of 42 respondents who dug up data on how traders make loans to moneylenders who have been around for years in the midst of traders. The research approach was carried out qualitatively by the survey method by distributing questionnaires containing 36 statements to measure traders' perceptions about the factors influencing considerations in credit application decisions. Then the data is processed using SPSS version 21 with descriptive and inductive statistics using multiple linear regression analysis and moderating variable analysis. The results of this study are that partially, irrational and rational considerations have a significant effect on the decision to submit credit with a significance value of 0,000 and 0.024 respectively, while simultaneously also a significant effect with a significance value of 0,000. The moderating variable test shows a significance value of 0.146 or greater than 0.05 which means that the rational consideration factor has not been a barrier for traders to keep deciding on credit applications.},

For example, at SDN 12 OKU still using the promotion information system manually, so allows the delivery of the results of a message you want delivery is slow and less effective. So on the school side experience the lack of maximum promotional media and on the part of the community is lacking find out more about SDN 12 OKU schools. Based on the results It is these findings and research that the authors try to analyze and design a website for SDN 12 OKU. So it is hoped that later become an official online media promotion by using the .sch.id extension and making the public clearer about information about SDN 12 OKU accurately. The method used in conducting this research using system analysis work steps. In analyzing and designing a system consisting of problem definition, feasibility study, system design, system detail, system implementation and evaluation. From making this system the author uses the CodeIgniter3 framework with PHP MySQL which will produce a school website for SDN 12 which later can increase the efficiency of SDN 12 OKU schools as well increase the use of computer human.

menggunakan Ms. Excel dasar, hal ini dapat mengakibatkan kerugian karena tidak validnya data dan lamanya
proses penginputan. Masalah yang sering terjadi adalah seringnya terjadi kesalahan dalam pencatatan data
transaksi pemesanan dan penjualan barang sehingga mengakibatkan kesulitan dalam pengendalian persediaan
barang. Penyebab dari permasalahan tersebut adalah pengolahan data transaksi yang kurang tepat, seperti
pencatatan invoice, formulir dan laporan. Apabila terjadi masalah penyimpanan, komputerisasi aplikasi
diperlukan agar pencatatan pengeluaran dan barang berjalan dengan baik, informasi terpusat lebih efisien, dan
informasi yang dihasilkan lebih akurat dan tepat. Dengan menerapkan sistem informasi barang dagangan
berbasis web, perusahaan dapat mempermudah dan mempercepat penyediaan informasi persediaan. Aplikasi
inventory ini dapat memudahkan pencataan barang masuk dan keluar serta pembuatan laporan stok barang.
Dengan dikembangkannya aplikasi inventory ini, efisiensi perusahaan dapat ditingkatkan. Dalam perancangan
aplikasi ini, penulis menggunakan metode Waterfall System Development Live Cycle (SDLC), dimana dalam
metode ini pembuatan sistem dilakukan secara teratur dan terukur pada setiap tahapannya. Model sistem

The result of the project is an analysis of business flow, system flow, business model, then the final result is a desktop-based application design that has various features in it according to the company's needs. The features available in the application include goods data, supplier data, customer data, employee data, and transaction data (sales, purchases and returns). These features, apart from being able to enter data, also provide access to update and delete. After the application design has been created, a feasibility analysis is carried out to determine whether the development of the system project is worth continuing or stopping, and the results obtained are that the application design created is declared feasible according to the results of behavioral testing or what can be called black box testing. The conclusion of this project is that the design of a desktop-based inventory application will definitely provide company efficiency and productivity by providing process automation, smoother work flow, and faster access to information, so that it can save time, costs, resources, and improve service quality.},

Banyak penginapan seperti hotel, villa, atau penginapan lainnya membutuhkan manajemen yang efisien dalam mengelola inventaris mereka, seperti peralatan, barang-barang kebersihan, perlengkapan kamar, dan sebagainya. Sebagian besar penginapan masih menggunakan metode manajemen inventaris tradisional yang melibatkan catatan manual atau penggunaan spreadsheet salah satunya pada penginapan wisma 9 ini. Hal ini rentan terhadap kesalahan manusia, sulit dilacak, dan memakan waktu. Dengan adanya aplikasi inventory gudang berbasis web dapat mengoptimalkan pengelolaan persediaan, mengurangi biaya operasional yang tidak perlu, menghindari kekurangan barang, dan meningkatkan kepuasan tamu dengan menyediakan barang-barang yang diperlukan secara tepat waktu. Aplikasi web ini memungkinkan manajemen gudang untuk memantau persediaan barang secara real-time. Mereka dapat melihat stok yang tersedia, barang yang sedang digunakan atau rusak, serta menerima notifikasi ketika persediaan mencapai batas minimum atau ketika ada kekurangan barang. Aplikasi web inventory gudang dapat menyediakan data dan laporan yang dapat digunakan untuk menganalisis tren penggunaan barang, mengidentifikasi pola permintaan, dan membuat perkiraan kebutuhan persediaan di masa depan. Hal ini membantu manajemen penginapan dalam pengambilan keputusan strategis terkait persediaan dan pengadaan barang. Kata Kunci: Inventory Gudang; Wisma 9; Aplikasi Web. Abstract − The lodging industry has continued to experience significant growth in recent years. Many lodgings such as hotels, villas, or other lodgings require efficient management in managing their inventory, such as equipment, cleaning items, room equipment, and so on. Most of the inns still use traditional inventory management methods that involve manual records or the use of spreadsheets, one of which is at this Wisma 9 inn. It is prone to human error, difficult to track, and time consuming. With the existence of a web-based warehouse inventory application, it can optimize inventory management, reduce unnecessary operational costs, avoid shortages of goods, and increase guest satisfaction by providing the necessary items in a timely manner. This web application allows warehouse management to monitor inventory in real-time. They can see available stock, items that are in use or damaged, and receive notifications when inventory reaches a minimum level or when there is a shortage of goods. Warehouse inventory web applications can provide data and reports that can be used to analyze trends in the use of goods, identify demand patterns, and forecast future inventory needs. This helps lodging management in making strategic decisions regarding inventory and procurement of goods.},
